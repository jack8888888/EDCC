## Issuance of instructions

Diamond, known as "king of jewels", represents love and loyalty, and is regarded as a symbol of bravery and honor. As a long period investment tool, its price appreciation has been much more than the rate of inflation in the past one hundred years. It has always been in the image of "hard currency". Compared with the traditional investment tools such as dollar and gold, it has a significant advantage of stable price and easy maintenance.

However, at present, the world's proven diamond reserves are only two billion and five hundred million carats, estimated to be depleted in 40 years. At present, the world's diamond production is mainly concentrated in countries such as South Africa, Russia, Australia and other countries, and in the place where the diamond gold industry has the largest demand and the largest volume of trade, it is known as the capital of Dubai.

The emergence of the diamond chain has broken the traditional diamond industry and will bring greater value to the world's diamond industry.

Block chain has the core advantages of de centralization, complete and transparent information, distributed record storage and scripts, which can solve problems, data tracking and information anti-counterfeiting, security problems, and market order nonstandard problems in specific applications. It will be widely applied in the fields of energy, Internet, medical treatment, social networking and copyright protection.

The benefit drill chain, derived from Dubai, is using block chain technology to break the traditional trading mode of the diamond industry. According to the regulation of the standardized operation and development of the diamond industry initiated by the APCC of the International United Nations Organization, the profit drill chain records the mining, processing, marketing and collection of each diamond through the central words of the block chain. Hide, ensure the authenticity of the data. Completely solved the problem of lack of trust between diamond trading subjects.

In this context, the interest drill chain will reach a consensus with the International Diamond Association, which will be issued for four years and a total of 100 million EDCC, which will never be added.

Our mission is to build a diversified centralization network of asset registration and circulation through the diamond chain. So that every participant in the world can own a diamond product and provide an eternal guarantee service for the global diamond industry.
